## Exercise: *spread data, gather data*

Sometimes, we need to reshape our data.  Here long to wide is shown, and then we transform the wide form back to long.

## Exercise: *long to wide*

---

```{r long_to_wide, fig.height=3 , comment = " ", eval=T, echo=F}
gapminder %>% 
  select(country, continent, lifeExp, year) %>% 
  spread(key = year, value = lifeExp) ->
  gapminder_life_exp_wide 
```


`r apply_reveal("long_to_wide")`

## Exercise: *wide to long*

---


```{r wide_to_long, eval = T, echo=F, comment = " ", fig.height = preview_height}
gapminder_life_exp_wide %>% 
  gather(key = "year", value = "lifeExp", -country, -continent) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) ->
  gapminder_life_exp_long 
```


`r apply_reveal("wide_to_long")`
