## Target output: *GDP versus Population in 2007*



```{r gdp_versus_population, eval=T, echo=F, comment = " ", fig.height = preview_height}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  mutate(gdp_approx = gdpPercap * pop) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = pop / 1000000) +
  aes(y = gdp_approx / 1000000000) +
  geom_point(alpha = .6) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  aes(color = continent) +
  labs(title = "GDP versus Population in 2007") +
  labs(subtitle = "Data source: gapminder package in R") +
  labs(x = "Population (millions)") +
  labs(y = "GDP (billions)") +
  labs(color = "") +
  labs(caption = "Vis: Gina Reynolds for 'Tidyverse in Action'") +

## How do we get there?

We are going to 

- subset the data to the 2007 cases, so filter(year == 2007).  
- use mutate() to create a new variable called gdp_approx, which is created by multiplying the variables gdpPercap and population
- then we'll plot

Let's see this in action.
