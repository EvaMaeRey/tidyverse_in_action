## Target output: *Over or under 70 life expectency by continent*



```{r life_expectancy_70, eval = T, echo=F, comment = " ", fig.height = preview_height}
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1997) %>%
  select(country, continent, lifeExp) %>% 
  mutate(life_cats = 
           case_when(lifeExp >= 70 ~ "70+", 
                     lifeExp < 70 ~ "<70")) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = continent, y = life_cats) +
  geom_jitter(width = .25, height = .25) +
  aes(col = continent) +
  scale_color_discrete(guide = FALSE) +
  theme_dark() +
  labs(x = "", y = "") +
  labs(title = "")
```

## How do we get there?

We are going to 

- subset the data to the 1997 cases, so filter(year == 1997).  
- create a new variable called life_cats (life categories)
- then we'll plot

Let's see this in action.

`r paste(knitr::knit(text = partial_knit_chunks("life_expectancy_70")), collapse = "\n")`
