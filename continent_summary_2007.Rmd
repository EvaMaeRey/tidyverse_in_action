## Target output: Median life expectency by continent in 2007

```{r continent_summary_2007, eval=T, echo=F, comment = " ", fig.height = preview_height}
gapminder %>% 
  select(-pop, -gdpPercap) %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarise(median_life_exp = 
              median(lifeExp)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = continent) +
  aes(y = median_life_exp) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", size = 3, 
             alpha = .4) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,85)) +
  labs(title = "Median life expectency by continent in 2007") +
  labs(subtitle = "Data Source: Gapminder package in R") +
  labs(x = "") +
  labs(y = "Median life expectancy") +
  labs(caption = "Vis: Gina Reynolds for 'Tidyverse in Action'") +

## How do we get there?

We are going to 

- drop variables that we won't use, gdp and population.  This isn't necessary but helps us focus on the next steps. 
- subset the data to the rows where the year is 2007
- then declare there to be subsets within the data which are the groups in the continent variable (the function is group_by()).  
- for each group, we'll ask for mean of life expectancy (summarize). 
- then we'll plot  

Let's see this in action.
