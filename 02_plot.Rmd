# Now for some plotting.

We may use some of the wrangline steps, and feed the wrangled data into a ggplot() with a pipe:  %>%.

# Questions, Plot 1

How many geometric layers ("geoms") are in the final plot?

To which geometric layer do the aesthetics mapping "fill" apply, ie represents a variable in the data?

What does coord_flip() do?

How is NULL used?

When adding a geom layer, where does it appear, behind or in front of other layers?

# Plot 2

---

```{r plot2, eval=F, echo=F, comment = " "}
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = gdpPercap) +
  aes(y = lifeExp) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  geom_rug(size = 1) +
  aes(col = continent) +
  aes(col = lifeExp) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  aes(size = gdpPercap) +
  aes(size = pop) +
  geom_point(col = "darkgreen", size = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~ continent)
```


`r paste(knitr::knit(text = partial_knit_chunks("plot2")), collapse = "\n")`


---
# Questions Plot 2

How many geometric layers are in the final plot?

What does geom_rug do?

There are two times when the aesthetic mapping col is set and two times when the aesthetic mapping size is set. Which is the final setting?



---
# Plot 3

---

```{r plot3, eval=F, echo=F, comment = " ", message = FALSE, warning=F}
gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Europe") %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = year) +
  aes(y = lifeExp) +
  aes(alpha = year) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  aes(col = country) +
  aes(col = NULL) +
  aes(group = country)
```


`r paste(knitr::knit(text = partial_knit_chunks("plot3")), collapse = "\n")`


---
# Questions Plot 3

How many geometric layers are in the final plot?

What does the alpha setting do?
